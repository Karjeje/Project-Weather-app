This is a small weather app that uses the Visual Crossing API to get the weather data of a requested city. The app isn't finished.

Things that still need to be done:

- Edit how the page looks, when it's opened for the first time and data is yet to be fetched from the API

- Check what is stored in the local storage, which was used to reduce amount of requests to the API during development, and maybe remove local storage completely

- Style properly

- Add functionality to the days bar (display weather for upcoming days)

- Make table with hourly weather fit whole boxes and not cut them off...
